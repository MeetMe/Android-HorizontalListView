# HorizontalListView

HorizontalListView is an Android ListView widget which scrolls in a horizontal manner (in contrast with the SDK-provided ListView which scrolls vertically).

## Usage
To use in an XML layout:
 0. Include The Library into your project
 0. Make sure you are running ADT version 17 or greater
 0. Add this XML namespace to your layout `xmlns:widget="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"`
 0. Create the HorizontalListView as `com.meetme.android.horizontallistview.HorizontalListView`

**Example**:

    <com.meetme.android.horizontallistview.HorizontalListView
        xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:widget="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        android:id="@+id/HorizontalListView"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="100dp"
        android:divider="#878787"
        widget:dividerWidth="2dp" />

Notice you set the `dividerWidth` via the XML namespace you just defined as it is a custom attribute. All other attributes can only be set normally via the `android` namespace.

## Known Issues
 - Currently this widget only supports uniform width items. When the item width is not uniform it leads to the UI rendering in inconsistent corrupted states.

## Known limitations
 - Does not support trackball/d-pad navigation
 - Does not support scroll bars
 - Does not support header or footer views
 - Does not support disabled items
